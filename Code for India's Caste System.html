   <h1 style="color: Orange; margin-bottom:15px;">India's Caste System </h1>
  <h2 style="color:Blue"> What is India's Caste System </h2>
  <p> The Caste System is the system of dividing Hindus into castes.<br>
  There are 4 main castes and a caste which falls out of the main 4: </p>
  <ul style="float:left;">
  <li> Brahims </li>
  <li> Kshatriyas </li>
  <li> Vaisyas </li>
  <li> Sudras </li>
  <li> Dalits </li>
  </ul>
  <img src="caste.jpg" style="width:40%; height:50% float:right; margin-left:20px;">
  <p style="clear:both; margin-top:20px;">
  These four categories dictated lots of aspects in Hindu culture and social life <br>
  Brahims were recognized as priests and teachers, Kshatriyas were recognized as warriors and rulers. <br>
  Vaisyas were recognized as farmers and merchants, finally Sudras were known as labourers. This set up lots of <br>
  stereotypes, divided Hindus, the upper and lower castes always lived in segregation and their castes were always <br>
  indicated by their last names.
  </p>
  
  <h2 style="color: Green"> Why is it Happening? </h2>
  <p> The caste system dates back to almost more than a 1000 years ago, In the Manusmriti an authoritative Hindu book of <br>
  law acknowledges the caste system as the basis of order and regularity in society. But, Independent India's Constitution <br>
  banned discrimination on the basis of the caste back in 1950. They did this to bring a level playing field for everyone <br>
  and to correct historical injustices. But it is still practiced in modern day India as there is some corruption in the <br>
  government and in society.
  </p>
  <h2 style="color: purple"> Statistics </h2>
<ul>
  <li> The caste system prohibited marriages between different castes. (Like Brahims canâ€™t marry Sudras) </li>
  <li> If you have a mixture of castes it is called a Varna Samkaram </li>
  <li> The caste system is the most misrepresented, misinformed, misunderstood and misused aspects in Hinduism </li>
  <li> Outcaste in the Hindu caste system is an individual or group thrown out the caste due to some ritual offense </li>
  <li> Dalits are considered less than human </li> 
  <li> Dalits are exposed to do degrading task like disposing of dead bodies, unclogging sewers etc </li>  
</ul>
  <h2 style="color: red"> Non Profit Group Trying to Solve the Issue  </h2>
  <p>
    	A group which is trying to fix this issue is Navasarjan. This group was founded in 1988 by <br> Martin Macwan a Gujarati Dalit whose mission is to eliminate discrimination based on the<br> caste system espically for dalits. To ensure equality regardless of caste, gender or<br> class. Also, to make sure the rule of law is used properly. They are active in 3,000 different<br> villages in India. They use their funding from different sources around the world to make <br> schools and safe communities for the Dalits.

  <h2>
   3 Rights Being Violated:
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Article 1:
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Article 1 all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. But, in the caste <br> system Brahims and Dalits are not equal as Brahim's Get more of an advantage in life than<br> Dalits. For example, Brahims usually get the more high-paying jobs than the dalits due<br> to the lack of education the Dalits receive.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Article 23
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Article 23 everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment. But, in the caste<br> system some castes are forced to do a job just based on the caste. Dalits are forced<br> to clean the streets or unclog sewers.
  </p>
<h3>
  Article 16
  </h3>
<p>
  In Article 16 men and women of full age, without any limitations due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to find a family. In the caste system, upper castes can't marry lower castes. For example, Brahims and Dalits are prohibted to marriage. 
  </p>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p> The Caste System in India is the system where Hindus are divided into castes. These castes determined <br> your job or role in society. A non-profit group trying to solve this issue is Navasarjan where they try to bring equality <br> regardless of gender, caste or class. Furthermore, the caste system violates many rights in the Universal Decleration of rights. <br> As of now the caste system is being used much less in society today as it is looked down upon.
